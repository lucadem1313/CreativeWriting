Programming is quickly becoming the most marketable professional skill in the 21st century. Not only does programming itself directly offer benefits, but the critical thinking skills learned while programming are also important.

I learned to program for a project in sixth grade, and since then it has become my #1 passion, and my intended career. I have taught myself numerous different languages and technologies, but over the years I have focused on web development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python with MySQL. These are all used in harmony to create a seamless web experience.

Through programming, I became a far better problem-solver, learning to tackle challenges with unique strategies. I have learned to persevere past setbacks, and reroute my efforts to different strategies while never being afraid to delete large chunks of work if it isn't working.

These are all skills programming can teach you, so your question now may be: *how do I learn to program?*

That will be answered in my next blog post.

### How to learn programming

The easiest way to learn programming, is just to jump in. There are a number of great resources online, and frankly it doesn't matter which one you choose. My general recommendation is to learn Python, because of its simple syntax, or JavaScript, because of its widespread use and applicability to other languages like C++ and Java. 

Here are some solid starting points:

+ [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) (JavaScript)
+ [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/) (Python & more)
+ [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all) (Python, JavaScript & more)

Now that you have the tools to start learning about programming, just go out and do it! It is easy to get discouraged, so I would recommend keeping in mind what motivated you to start in the first place.

Good Luck!

### Applications of programming

#### By Luca Demian - 13 Feb. 2019


This blog post is a little different, because I am basically going to list some interesting future applications of programming. I will expand on some these applications in future posts.

+ **Artificial Intelligence** - I see this as one of the most compelling applications of computer science in coming years, more info coming in a future post :)
  + Machine Learning - Related to AI, this is also a promising field
+ **Security** - With all the headlines about hacking and cybersecurity failures in the news every day, along with the inherent insecurity of password-based systems, I foresee a radical change in how web security coming in the next few decades.
+ **Blockchain** - I'm sure you've heard of Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies, which are an interesting application of blockchain technology, but on top of currency blockchain has the potential to revolutionize fields across the board, wherever trust is involved.
+ **Streamlining** - Overall, the culmination of these and other computer science efforts will be to streamline all facets of our lives. In the coming years we may see smart fridges that buy your groceries for you, TVs that know what you will like, or self-driving cars that could actually earn you money.

### Artificial Intelligence

#### By Luca Demian - 13 Feb. 2019


Artificial Intelligence is the field of CS I am most interested in personally, because of its direct connection to mathematics and science, and the huge potential applicability to other fields. AI can be useful in so many industries it isn't even worth guessing where it will have the most impact.

My personal ambition, where I would love to apply AI, is to helping solve climate change. This issue is one of the greatest that our world faces in the coming century, and of great importance to me personally due to my love of the outdoors. AI can be used to assist geoscience research, to help optimize pollution-generating systems, or even to decrease power use.

### Security

Simply put, web security is nothing but a charade put on for  users so that they feel safe. The fact of the matter is that almost every single person online is able to be hacked by someone with enough resources and dedication. The issue when it comes to security is how to protect users from themselves, because unfortunately our humanity is the greatest vulnerability in most cyber security. No matter how safe and well-designed a login system is, if it password-based a savvy hacker can fairly easily manipulate the user into giving away their login&mdash;and they may not even realize what happened.

I don't really know what the future of websecurity will be, but I see potential in physical systems like Yubikey or Titan. These add an additional layer of security requiring real-world thievery on top of cyber-savvy to crack. In fact, Google has claimed that its implementation of security key technology completely stopped hacks against employees. Now that's promising!
